Missing features :

1- Sprite should be able to clip (stick) to another sprite.

Take an energy bar for example, you should be able to instantiate an energy bar sprite 
and then do something like energyBar.clipTo(heroInstance, offsetX, offsetY);
Then it would be render at the hero position + the offset.

2- There should be an Animation class

This would avoid passing all those parameters to a state object when creating it.
With that class we would only give a instance of Animation to the constructor.
This class should give enough freedom to control the animation at the state will.
This class should (may?) include the rendering algorithm.

3- Sprite should be able to have children

Take for example the case where the hero fire a rocket. This rocket should be 
the hero child Sprite.

4- The collider class is inside the generic engine but it is a game specific
file.

There should be something to replace it that is not game dependant.

5- Sprite added to the environment should be able to be spawned only once.

This about an energy canister that should never respawn.

5- State instances should be dealt with differently

The getInstance() thing is juste not clean. In fact all the state management
is dirty now. I think the spirte should hold an instance to all it's states
to fix many issues.
