#summary This page will contains all the documentation needed to successfully develop a game on Francois Gervais's SNES like console (AKA the GreenBox).
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

First off, you're gonna need SDL, Cygwin and a development tool (So far we did it with VS 2010 and Eclipse Galileo). We're just starting of so don't worry, we'll complete this documentation as we advance in our game.

Update, the docs for the windows Setup is now available as a wiki and as files on the SVN: SetupWindows

*IMPORTANT*
<br />
There are some constraint to follow for the project to be portable to the console.
  * No _int_, Use *uint32`_`t*
  * No _String_ (not even functions in the string library), Use *char`*`*
  * No _boolean_! use *uint8`_`t (0,1)*
